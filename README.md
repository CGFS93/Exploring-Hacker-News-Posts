Curious to see what other students have done on this project? Head over to our Community to check them out. While you are there, please give your own feedback!

And of course, we welcome you to share your own project and show off your hard work. Head over to our Community to share your finished Guided Project!

You can use guided projects to build a portfolio to showcase to potential employers, so we encourage you to keep working on this. Here are some next steps for you to consider:

Determine if show or ask posts receive more points on average.
Determine if posts created at a certain time are more likely to receive more points.
Compare your results to the average number of comments and points other posts receive.
Use Dataquest's data science project style guide to format your project.
You're welcome to keep working on the project here, but we recommend downloading it to your computer using the download icon above the notebook and working on it locally.

If you choose to work on the next steps independently, you'll inevitably not know how to perform certain tasks or hit errors that you won't know how to resolve. Don't feel discouraged! This is part of the learning process. Although referring to other lessons is a great way to refresh your memory on certain topics, there are also some tools you should practice using because you'll need to use them in a real-world job setting.

The best thing to do if you hit an error you can't resolve or don't know how to perform a task is search for the answer on Google. When you search, make sure to include the word "python" — otherwise, you'll get results from other programming languages.

As you search, you'll see one site constantly appear at the top of the results — Stack Overflow. Stack Overflow is an online community where people ask and answer programming questions. In most situations, you'll find that someone has asked the same question as you — or a similar question that can help you. The community is very active, so the answers are almost always accurate.
